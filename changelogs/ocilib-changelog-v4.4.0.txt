            * Fixed broken support for XA connections
            * Added 2 new error codes related to XA connections management (OCI_ERR_XA_ENV_FROM_STRING, OCI_ERR_XA_CONN_FROM_STRING)

         - Fix for Oracle bug #9838993 workaround
            * Version 4.2.1 introduced support for an experimental workaround for Oracle bug 9838993 (memory leak when using unicode and re-preparing/executing same statement multiple times)
            * This support was not anlways working as column names where sometimes not null terminated
            
    * Enhancements (C API)
              
        - OCI_Object: Supporting now non final object types
            * if an OCI_Object instance real type is a sub type of its column object type, OCILIB is dynamically retrieving its real and right type instead of processing it as its base type
            * Added missing synchronized access when iterating the list of existing OCI_TypeInfo in OCI_TypeInfoGet()
        - Allocation Binding mode updates
            * Added BindGetAllocationMode()
            * updated OCI_GetBindAllocation() and OCI_SetBindAllocation() documentation to properly specify their usage
        - Extended 12cR2 support:
            * Increased identifier size to 128
            * Added OCI_ColumnGetCollationID
            * Added more Oracle Session Mode               
        - Refactored OCI_List implementation (Internal change
            * No more access to OCI_List fields from other compilation units (encapsulation purposes)
            * Refactored OCI_List implementation
