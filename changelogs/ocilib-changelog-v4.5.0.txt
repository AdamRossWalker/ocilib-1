    * Enhancements (C and C++ API)

        - Extended support for non final UTDs
            * Added OCI_TypeInfoGetSuperType() and ocilib::TypeInfo::GetSuperType()
            * Added OCI_TypeInfoIsFinalType() and ocilib::TypeInfo::IsFinalType()
            * Added C and C++ demos about super types and sub types    

    * Fixes (C API)
    
        - Issue #132, #133, #135: Fixed segfault while accessing to derived UTDs members (due to wrong members offset computation)
        - Issue #134: OCI_ObjectToText() and OCI_CollToText() were mangling conversion errors leading OCI_GetLastError() to not report conversion errors         
        - Issue #136: OCI_RegisterSubscription() was not correctly setting port number if provided
        - Issue #137: BINARY_DOUBLE and BINARY_FLOAT values could not be set or retrieved from OCI_Elem and OCI_Object
        - Issue #139: OCI_ErrorGetInternalCode() may report wrong OCI_ERR_* value

    * Miscellaneous:

        - Refactored internal numeric types conversions
        - Removed usage of deprecated symbols
        - Some code cleanup
