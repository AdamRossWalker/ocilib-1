    * Fixes (C)
	
       - Fixed compile and run time Oracle version detection when Oracle version is >= 18.1
	   - Fixed OCI_SetTimeout() that was setting all timeouts with input value
	   - Fixed OCI_GetTimeout() that was returning OCI_NTO_CALL or OCI_NTO_RECEIVE value whatever requested timeout
	   - Added macro OCI_VER_MAKE to make an ocilib compliant oracle version from major, minor and revision versions (e.g. OCI_VER_MAKE(18,3,0) equals OCI_18_3)
	   - Updated Oracle versions constants
	   
    * Fixes (C++ API)
	
       - Issue #197: Using C++ interface in multiple DLLs
