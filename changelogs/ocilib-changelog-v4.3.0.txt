2016-11-09 Version 4.3.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * New Features: 
    
         - Added NUMBER SQL type native wrapping 
         
            * Optional type as NUMBER type can still be fetched/binded using regular C native numeric types
            * New OCI_Number type can be used when precision matters or for dealing with special values such as positive and negative infinity
            * C API : 
                - Added OCI_NUM_NUMBER numeric type
                - Added OCI_Number type
                - Added OCI_NumberCreate()
                - Added OCI_NumberFree()
                - Added OCI_NumberArrayCreate()
                - Added OCI_NumberArrayFree()
                - Added OCI_NumberAssign()
                - Added OCI_NumberGetContent()
                - Added OCI_NumberSetContent()
                - Added OCI_NumberSetValue()
                - Added OCI_NumberGetValue()
                - Added OCI_NumberAdd()
                - Added OCI_NumberSub()
                - Added OCI_NumberMultiply()
                - Added OCI_NumberDivide()
                - Added OCI_NumberCompare()
                - Added OCI_GetNumber()
                - Added OCI_GetNumber2()
                - Added OCI_BindNumber()
                - Added OCI_BindArrayOfNumbers()
                - Added OCI_RegisterNumber()
                - Added OCI_NumberFromText()
                - Added OCI_NumberToText()
                - Added OCI_ElemGetNumber()
                - Added OCI_ElemSetNumber()
                - Added OCI_ObjectGetNumber()
                - Added OCI_ObjectSetNumber()
                
            * C++ API: 
                - Added ocilib::Number type encapsulating the C API OCI_Number type
                - This new type comes with all possible operator overloads for better usability
 
    * Fixes:

        - OCI_ObjectGetString(): Fixed usage of internal temporary buffers
        - OCI_FileRead(): Return value was not the correct one
        - OCI_PoolGetConnection() : was returning NULL connections for session pool using external credentials
        - OCI_StringGetFromType() : Fixed segfault when converting CLOBs (with length > to 512) to UTF8 strings in OCI_GetString() if an UTF8 charset is used
        - Fix indicators usage for collections : OCI_IsNull() always returned FALSE even if fetched collection was NULL
        - Fix compilation under C compilers not supporting C99 feature allowing declaring variables anywhere in blocks
 
    * Miscellaneous:
    
        - C API: Major internal code re-factoring
        
            * Code factorization
            * Replaced verbose macros with more compact ones
            * Code base reduced by few thousands lines of code
            * Fixed some error handling logic
            
        - C API: 
        
            * Added OCI_GetDataSize() and OCI_GetDataSize2()
        
        - C++ API: 

            * Rewrote iterators for ocilib::Collection<> 
                - Collection Iterators are now random iterators allowing Collections being used with STL algorithms such as std::sort()
                - Added Collection const_iterators
            * Addressed various code analysis hints
            * Added C++ compiler capabilities detection (C+11)

        - Updated samples in folder /demo

            * Added required DDL and DML for all samples
            * Updated some samples
